Our game is a side swipper where the user has control of the chosen bird in the level and can alter its position with up and down arrow keys. In each of the two levels(One migratory and One non Migratory) the user must navigate through obstacles while collecting food to increase its health bar. Special food objects will appear and if captured the user will be asked a question and if it is answered correctly the user will recieve extra health. At the end of the level there is a nesting animation to transition to the next level.
